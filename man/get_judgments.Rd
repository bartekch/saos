## From list of IDs
# single ID
judgments1 <- get_judgments(1)

# vector of IDs
judgments2 <- get_judgments(c(1, 100))

# vector of IDs with non-existent judgment
judgments3 <- get_judgments(c(128334, 1, 100))


## From search results
search <- search_judgments(limit = 10, verbose = FALSE)
judgments4 <- get_judgments(search)
